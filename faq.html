<h2 id="about-wrapper-offline">About Wrapper: Offline</h2>

<h3 id="what-is-wrapper-offline">What is Wrapper: Online?</h3>
<p>Wrapper: Online (simply called “Online” for the rest of this page) is a continuation of the original Wrapper project, which was taken down approximately on 2020-04-17. Unlike the original, Offline can not be taken down. Everything it needs to run is stored entirely on your computer. While its current use is for making content, the motive is to make a historical archive for the original Flash-based themes used with this editor.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-wrapper-offline">Wait a second. This is hosted on a website! It will get DMCA'ed!</h3>
<p>Nah man, it'd be impossible under the IP as far as I know. And even IF Vyond tries to DMCA us, we'll have a valid argument ready, so don't worry.</p>


<h3 id="will-it-work-forever-even-after-flash-is-retired">Will it work forever? Even after Flash is retired?</h3>
<p>It should, that’s the goal. Perhaps in the future when we all run 6000-bit machines implanted into our brains it won’t be compatible with that anymore, but I’m sure there’ll always be a way to run it. There is also futureproofing for Flash’s discontinuation, since Offline includes a Flash install and a version of ungoogled-chromium that supports Flash. By default, it starts from this, but you can change that in settings.bat. The included Chrome should not be used for browsing beyond using Flash content. You can also look into projects like <a href="http://lightspark.github.io/">Lightspark</a> and <a href="https://ruffle.rs/">ruffle</a> that are attempting to recreate Flash.</p>


  

<h3 id="wait-chromium-ive-heard-something-about-that-being-a-virus">Wait… Chromium? I’ve heard something about that being a virus…</h3>
<p>Chromium is literally Chrome. It’s the libre software base Google uses to build Chrome, and then they tack proprietary parts like auto-updates and Google integration in so it’s more appealing and they have more control over your experience. Ungoogled-chromium is just a version of Chromium that has any Google integration that’s left in Chromium removed for privacy.
If you don’t trust me, feel free to look through the code on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium">https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium</a>
And these VirusTotal results for it: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection">https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bab1f622f9a966baffa07838c305e586715979db884cd7369df96bb08c092f8a/detection</a>

<h2 id="using-offline">Using Online</h2>

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h3>
<p>boi just go on the site</p>


<h3 id="can-i-import-character-ids-from-the-original-lvm">Can I import character IDs from the original LVM?</h3>
<p>Also yes! To do that, go to the matching character creator, and paste <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;original_asset_id=ID HERE</code> at the end of the URL.</p>






<h3 id="file-uploading-isnt-working">File uploading isn’t working!</h3>
<p>too bad dont have any way to fix this</p>
<h3 id="business-friendly-and-whiteboard-are-missing">Business Friendly and Whiteboard are missing!</h3>
<p>I go into this in more detail in the legalese section, but basically Vyond is still using them so I won’t include them in Offline.</p>

<h3 id="watermarks-arent-working">Watermarks aren’t working!</h3>
<p>This is likely tied to file uploading not working. You’re likely better off either placing them over your video as a prop, or using a video editor to place them on your video. My recommendations are Kdenlive and OpenShot, both of them are libre software you can use for free.</p>



<h3 id="starters-arent-working">Starters aren’t working!</h3>
<p>I currently have no fix for this, you’ll just have to either copy them directly from projects or recreate them.</p>

<h3 id="resizing-set-in-the-character-creator-breaks-when-playing">Resizing set in the Character Creator breaks when playing!</h3>
<p>I currently have no fix for this, you’ll just have to size them manually in the editor. Head resizing should be working fine, it’s the size of the entire character that’s broken.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-offline-on">Can I use Offline on…</h2>


<h2 id="legalese-things-i-guess">Legalese things I guess</h2>




<h3 id="why-is-business-friendly-missing">Why is Business Friendly missing?</h3>
<p>Vyond still uses that theme, and unless they abandon the theme I have no good reason to keep it in . It’s still available in their paid service, and even if it’s an inferior version it’s effectively just piracy at that point. Removing it, as well as a few other themes, is to try to avoid hurting Vyond. To quote the original Wrapper dev, VisualPlugin, on why Vyond took it down: “Vyond’s objection is my unauthorised use of their intellectual property and their logo. It doesn’t matter if it’s Comedy World or Business Friendly - it’s all theirs.” And while they’re all still theirs, the original themes are completely abandoned and without Wrapper: Offline they would be completely unarchived beyond what’s shown in videos. This project is important to make sure that they are preserved. Business Friendly doesn’t need preservation right now.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-you-avoid-mentioning-the-original-service-goanimatevyond">Why do you avoid mentioning the original service GoAnimate/Vyond?</h3>
<p>Because they are NOT affiliated or endorsing this project in any form. Wrapper: Offline is and almost certainly always will be a completely separate project. That’s why the full name is simply Wrapper: Offline, and referring to it with that company’s name (such as calling it GoAnimate Wrapper Offline) is wrong.</p>

<h3 id="wait-youre-using-vyonds-copyrighted-material-thats-illegal">Wait, you’re using Vyond’s copyrighted material, that’s illegal!</h3>
<p>We are using their copyrighted material, yes. I don’t think there’s any denying that. But I’m trying to avoid hurting Vyond. I already removed all the themes used in current Vyond (business friendly, whiteboard, etc) because I don’t want to intrude on their user base, and I removed their branding as best as I could to separate this project from them and show that we aren’t affiliated in any way. I’ve also added a disclaimer when starting Offline for the first time to make people fully aware of what they’re going into. If people want a solid fast engine with professional themes, they’ll go to Vyond, and I know there are people that genuinely use their service for business purposes. If people just want to make silly YouTube videos using themes they’re nostalgic for, or want to see a historical archive of these old abandoned themes, they’ll come here. The way I see it, the content in Offline has all been abandoned and mostly given a negative image  (grounded videos) that makes them avoided, and this is a way for us to preserve them for future people to learn about. By the time the copyright expires, nobody will care enough to preserve it. And I’m a strong believer that software should be preserved once it’s been abandoned. If I download and play an old game that’s no longer being sold officially, they’ve already stopped people from giving them money for it. I view this the exact same way. An obscure Garfield puzzle game from a decade ago only a few people remember deserves the same preservation as a famous game everyone played when it released. I’ve said it before, and I’ll keep saying it for likely the rest of my life.</p>
